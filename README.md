This is a static site for my SAT Math tutoring. 

It's built from a Jekyll template that I used in 2022 when I didn't know anything about web development.

Fast forward to the present. I still know nothing about web development, but the website is a relic of what it used to be.

Regardless, it's easy to navigate and serves its purpose well. If you know someone who needs SAT math tutoring, be sure to send them here.

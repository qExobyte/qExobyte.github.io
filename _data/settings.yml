    content: "<strong>Learning from Eric was the best decision I made before taking the SAT</strong>. Before I started learning from him, I felt discouraged because I couldn't see any improvements in my math score. I learned a lot of things from him that I wouldn't have been able to figure out if I just self-studied. <strong>He also put in a lot of time and effort into personalizing my experience</strong>, helping me to focus on the areas I needed to improve. In every tutoring session, he was patient and understanding, and <strong>I felt really comfortable asking questions and making mistakes</strong>. I would recommend Eric to anyone taking the SAT because he really cares about helping his students succeed and makes studying effective and enjoyable!"

    content: "<strong>My score increased faster than I thought was possible</strong>. Eric understands the SAT math on a deep level and can solve any problem I give him. He taught me not just how to solve problems, but how to think about them. Talking through my work out loud was especially impactful. Not only did I get a 750, but I've become a much better problem solver after learning from Eric."

    content : "Since I found Eric online, <strong>it has been a life changing experience for me</strong>! He is very knowledgeable in the field of math, especially in Algebra and SAT Math, not only explaining how to solve problems, but also in depth reasoning behind the math. <strong>I was struggling with SAT math and feeling discouraged, but Eric's patient and encouraging approach helped me gain confidence</strong>. He will explain in detail any way possible for you to understand, plus provide helpful tips and tricks that make problem solving not only easier, but also faster. With his guidance and support, I was able to achieve my goal (SAT Math 750+). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Eric as a math tutor to anyone in need of help in math."

  - name: "Aanya"
    designation2: "580 to 710 in 8 hours"
    content: "<strong>Eric's math tutoring has helped me more than any textbook I have used</strong>. I was struggling with the math section of the SAT, staying at the same score even with months of studying. However once I found Eric's tutoring, my score improved significantly. Eric not only helped me get to the right answer for a problem, but he also made sure that I understood the reasoning behind it in depth. This was very beneficial as previously other tutors, textbooks, and even College Boards explanations would give me the long, tedious way to solve a problem, which no one has time to do on the SAT. I would highly recommend Eric for anyone who needs help in SAT math."

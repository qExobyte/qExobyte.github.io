    designation: "Masterclass December Cohort"
    designation2: "690 to 770"
    content: "I cannot recommend Eric's group classes enough! I was completely stuck and unsure how to improve my math score, struggling to identify what I was missing. <strong>Eric’s group classes changed everything—he covered everything I encountered on test day.</strong> His teaching goes beyond rote learning; he focuses on building a <strong>solid foundational understanding</strong> of the concepts and equips students with strategies to approach <strong>every problem confidently</strong>."

  - name: "Jacob"
    designation: "Masterclass June Cohort"
    designation2: "630 (March) to 770 (June)"
    content: "Eric's Masterclass truly changed the trajectory of my SAT journey, and potentially, my life. Before I had enrolled in his class, I had <strong>no idea how to study</strong> for the SAT Math. I did not find studying for the SAT remotely interesting. This changed entirely once I joined Eric's Masterclass. He made learning not only accessible but genuinely enjoyable. I was absolutely <strong>ecstatic</strong> to see that my math score increased <strong>140 points.</strong> I truly don’t think I could have made such a dramatic improvement without Eric’s expert help, and I can’t thank him enough."

  - name: "Yuna"
    designation: "770 in 8 hours of tutoring"
    content: "<strong>Learning from Eric was the best decision I made before taking the SAT</strong>. Before I started learning from him, I felt discouraged because I couldn't see any improvements in my math score. I learned a lot of things from him that I wouldn't have been able to figure out if I just self-studied. <strong>He also put in a lot of time and effort into personalizing my experience</strong>, helping me to focus on the areas I needed to improve. In every tutoring session, he was patient and understanding, and <strong>I felt really comfortable asking questions and making mistakes</strong>."

  - name: "Jack"
    designation: "Masterclass March Cohort"
    content: "The Masterclass has undoubtedly been the <strong>single best decision I made</strong> when preparing for the SAT. Initially I was worried that since the class was in a group setting, I wouldn't receive enough direct teaching of the material. But I was wrong! <strong>Eric made sure to answer everyone's questions</strong>, and the pacing of the class allowed for us to take the time to learn everything thoroughly. Not only were the sessions themselves helpful, but Eric provided <strong>all of the resources and advice</strong> I needed for studying on my own."

  - name: "Wyatt"
    designation: "Group Classes"
    designation2: "630 to 740"
    content: "When Eric says the SAT math score is the quickest way you can improve your college admissions, <strong>he is not lying.</strong> Taking his December SAT group classes and doing no work outside of sessions improved my score by 100 points. If you are serious about improving your SAT score <strong>fast</strong> at a <strong>reasonable price</strong> compared to other SAT tutors, <strong>taking Eric’s SAT class is a no brainer.</strong>"

  - name: "Sam"
    designation: "Masterclass December Cohort"
    designation2: "650 to 770"
    content: "Taking group classes with Eric helped boost my SAT score tremendously! His class materials were well-thought-out, original, and personalized. <strong>There was no pressure to answer problems correctly, and there was no judgment if a student made mistakes.</strong> He has an engaging personality, so <strong>while I typically don't like studying math, I genuinely enjoyed each session.</strong> While taking the SAT, I encountered several math concepts that we had covered together!"

  - name: "Aster"
    designation: "Masterclass March Cohort"
    content: "Eric is an incredible SAT math tutor! His group classes were engaging, well-structured, and filled with helpful strategies that <strong>made even the toughest math problems feel manageable.</strong> He explained concepts clearly, patiently answered all our questions, and <strong>ensured everyone kept up.</strong> His practice problems and test-taking tips helped me gain confidence! If you're looking for a tutor who makes SAT math <strong>both effective and enjoyable,</strong> I highly recommend him!"

  - name: "James"
    designation: "640 to 750 in 8 hours"
    content: "<strong>My score increased faster than I thought was possible</strong>. Eric understands the SAT math on a deep level and can solve any problem I give him. He taught me not just how to solve problems, but how to think about them. Talking through my work out loud was especially impactful. Not only did I get a 750, but I've become a much better problem solver after learning from Eric."

  - name: "Aaron"
    designation: "Masterclass December Cohort"
    designation2: "650 to 790"
    content: "Eric really understands the SAT because he himself took it so he can teach you all the tips and tricks to solve the hard questions that the SAT throws at you. <strong>He makes it super easy to understand each concept.</strong> Also, he gives so many study materials and plans. My math score was maxed out at 650 before Eric's classes, but now I was able to get a 790. I highly recommend this course for anyone who is taking the SAT."

  - name: "Mujtaba"
    content: "Eric's method of teaching was <strong>perfect</strong> for a student like me. Each hard concept with just a little bit of practice and explaining from him improved my score another 10-20 points. <strong>His materials are exactly what you need to get as close to the 800 as possible.</strong> You won't see questions harder than that on the real thing so the practice is identical to the test. I think it's a great idea to <strong>invest</strong> in Eric if you're looking for a high score."

We focused on the process of <strong>solving problems, instead of the actual answer,</strong> and this helped build speed and <strong>change my approach</strong> to solving problems to the most efficient possible way.

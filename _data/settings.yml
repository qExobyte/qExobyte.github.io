    content : "I wouldn’t have done nearly as well on the SAT Math without Eric. He understands the test on a deep level and can immediately identify where I’m going wrong with problems. As a college student, he’s very down to earth and good at communicating. His rate is affordable, especially for what you get. Eric has made studying for the SAT somehow enjoyable and I strongly recommend his tutoring."

    designation: "SAT Math & AP Computer Science A"
    designation2: "660 to 760 in 2 months"
    content : "Since I found Eric online, it has been a life changing experience for me! He is very knowledgeable in the field of math, especially in Algebra and SAT Math, not only explaining how to solve problems, but also in depth reasoning behind the math. I was struggling with SAT math and feeling discouraged, but Eric's patient and encouraging approach helped me gain confidence. He will explain in detail any way possible for you to understand, plus provide helpful tips and tricks that make problem solving not only easier, but also faster. With his guidance and support, I was able to achieve my goal (SAT Math 750+). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Eric as a math tutor to anyone in need of help in math."

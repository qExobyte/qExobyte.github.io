    content : "I wouldn’t have done nearly as well on the SAT Math without Eric. He understands the test on a deep level and can immediately identify where I’m going wrong with problems. As a college student, he’s very down to earth and good at communicating. His rate is affordable, especially for what you get. Eric has made studying for the SAT somehow enjoyable and I strongly recommend his tutoring."

    designation2: "660 to 760 in 8 hours"
    content : "Since I found Eric online, it has been a life changing experience for me! He is very knowledgeable in the field of math, especially in Algebra and SAT Math, not only explaining how to solve problems, but also in depth reasoning behind the math. I was struggling with SAT math and feeling discouraged, but Eric's patient and encouraging approach helped me gain confidence. He will explain in detail any way possible for you to understand, plus provide helpful tips and tricks that make problem solving not only easier, but also faster. With his guidance and support, I was able to achieve my goal (SAT Math 750+). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Eric as a math tutor to anyone in need of help in math."

  - name: "Aanya"
    designation: "SAT Math"
    designation2: "580 to 710 in 8 hours"
    content: "Eric's math tutoring has helped me more than any textbook I have used. I was struggling with the math section of the SAT, staying at the same score even with months of studying. However once I found Eric's tutoring, my score improved significantly. Eric not only helped me get to the right answer for a problem, but he also made sure that I understood the reasoning behind it in depth. This was very beneficial as previously other tutors, textbooks, and even College Boards explanations would give me the long, tedious way to solve a problem, which no one has time to do on the SAT. I would highly recommend Eric for anyone who needs help in SAT math."

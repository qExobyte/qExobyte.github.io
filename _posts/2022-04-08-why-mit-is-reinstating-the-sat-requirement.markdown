In 2020 and 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, MIT removed the requirement for applicants to submit SAT or ACT scores. During these two years, MIT's admissions office has conducted research on the effects of this policy change. Many people expected this experiment to result in the gradual dissolution of the SAT. Instead, MIT has actually reinstated the SAT as a requirement for admission.

Those who oppose the SAT point to the gap between the SAT scores of rich students and poor students. However, MIT found that of all factors considered for college admissions (essays, grades, test scores, extracurriculars, etc.), test scores were some of the *least* subject to this wealth-disparity.

While rich families can pay for grade-inflated private schools, essay editors, and prestigious extracurriculars, they cannot (in the vast majority of circumstances) pay for a good SAT score. Test scores are the *only* standardized metric on college applications. Rich or poor, you take the same test.

Granted, test prep courses, books, and private tutoring all exist as resources exclusive to those with money to spend. As a private SAT tutor, I know this very well. However, I'm going to take a potentially surprising stance for an SAT tutor to take: it is possible to succeed on the SAT without paying a single dollar for resources. Collegeboard's practice tests and Khan Academy are sufficient test prep to get whatever score is desired. They show with full transparency what will be on the test and how to prepare for it.

Likewise, virtually everything that is taught in school can be learned without a teacher. Algebra, world history, biology, you name it, can be self-taught with a computer and an internet connection. A tutor serves the same role as a teacher--not a necessity for learning but a facilitator of it. Contrary to what many prep courses and tutors may claim, private tutors do not provide the "hidden keys" to the SAT, but they can make the process of learning more engaging and efficient. Tutors provide structure, accountability, and explanations deliberately tailored to the student.

My intent as a tutor is to help students better reason through math. *Yes, this formula is used on the SAT, but do you understand why it works as it does?* Improving students' conceptual understanding of math and how to approach problems makes them stronger thinkers overall, and SAT score improvements follow as a result. 

So yes, private tutoring is advantageous--not because it unlocks the secrets to the SAT, but simply because good teachers make good students. Just as it would be misguided to blame talented, effective teachers for inequity in education, it would be misguided to blame the tutoring industry or the SAT itself for inequity in college admissions. 

Inequity in education is a valid concern, but it begins far before the college admissions process. Kids' schools are determined by their parents' properties and public school systems fail to fund their schools and teachers sufficiently to ensure equal opportunity.

The SAT continues to be the one of the most equitable aspects of the college admissions process, and we should focus on improving its affordability and accessibility, rather than dissolving it for its imperfections.

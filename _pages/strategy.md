When tutoring, I employ the same practices that helped me get a perfect math score on the SAT. Here is an outline of my strategy:

**Fire before aiming:** The best way to assess strengths and weaknesses is to take the test head on--even if you feel unprepared. Whether it's taking the PSAT or completing a practice test at home (*but under testing conditions*), taking the test *before* knowing what to expect (hence firing before aiming) is the best way to start test prep. With plenty of practice tests available, my tutoring revolves heavily around students completing practice tests between tutoring sessions, so we can spend sessions deliberately targeting *weaknesses* from those tests.

**Intuition first:** Many students have experienced math classes that prioritize memorization of formulas and theorems over actually understanding them. This not only makes learning math less interesting, but also less effective. Memorizing a narrow process only helps you solve a narrow set of problems. To complete the SAT with accuracy and speed, you need to be able to apply familiar concepts to *unfamiliar* problems, so a solid conceptual understanding is vital. When a student is shaky on a math concept, I start from the most rudimentary place, and explain the concept in such a way that answers the question "why is this important?". 

**Problem types & Solution frameworks:** In the last paragraph I said that the SAT contains *unfamiliar* problems. While this is true, there are also many *problem types* that occur over and over again. If you can identify one of these recurring problems, you can turn to a reliable process for finding the solution (a "solution framework"). Having a designated plan for how to approach each type of problem allows you to move through the test *significantly* faster. 

These three ideas make up the core of my math tutoring strategy. Students complete and score timed practice tests on their own between sessions, come to each session with a list of problems they missed or want to go over, and during sessions I teach the concepts and solution frameworks to prepare students for their next practice test.

Some other things I value in tutoring:

**The Feynman Technique:** The best way to know if you really understand a topic is to try explaining it. I often ask students to explain a topic to me to test their understanding.

**Spaced Repetition:** Rather than covering math topics in a straight order, I ensure that students are reviewing concepts over and over again, through deliberate practice during sessions and in practice tests.

**Building a Connection with the Student:** This seems obvious, but students need to feel very comfortable around their tutor to have effective and enjoyable tutoring sessions. Since I'm close in age to the students, I feel like I have a much easier time getting students to be open around me than most tutors would. It's vital that students don't hesitate to ask questions, share their thoughts, or just speak as they normally would.

**Seeing learning from a student's perspective:** In 2016, the SAT was completely revamped by College Board. However, most SAT tutors learned and took the test far before 2016. As someone who learned and completed the SAT after the revamp, I can see the SAT, as well as the college admissions process surrounding it, from the perspective of a student today. I believe this does make an impact when teaching and building a connection with students.

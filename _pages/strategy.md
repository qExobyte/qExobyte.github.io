Over my 200+ hours tutoring SAT Math, I've been dedicated to continuously improving my tutoring methodology. Here is what's worked:

<h3>Practice Tests</h3>
The best way to prepare for the SAT is to take the SAT.

In general, tests don't only serve as tools for assessment, but also as tools for *learning*. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6920642/#:~:text=Testing%20or%20retrieval,eg%2C%20marginal%20knowledge).">Cognitive science</a> consistently finds testing to be the best form of studying for long-term retention, since it demands greater attention and helps identify gaps in knowledge. 

But why official practice tests? Success on the SAT ultimately comes down to **pattern recognition**. I prove this by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgANv_aeJkQ">finishing the 25 minute non-calculator section in just under 4 minutes</a>. I'm not using any superhuman abilities nor am I using any math beyond Algebra 2. The reason I can "speedrun" the test is that I've developed an *intuition* for the problems on the SAT Math. 

In the same way that you can read this paragraph without consciously thinking about grammar rules, once you've developed an intuition for SAT problems, you'll know how to solve each problem without thinking deeply about it. When you see a problem, your brain will draw connections to similar problems you've seen in the past, and it'll want to apply the processes that worked for those problems to this new one. But these connections can only be made if the problems from your studying are representative of the problems on the SAT. **This is why I believe the official SAT practice tests and past SATs are the best resource to use.**

However, when diving straight into practice tests, there are going to be concepts and processes that the student is unfamiliar with or has questions about. This is where my tutoring comes in. Students complete practice tests between tutoring sessions and come to each session with a list of problems to go over. Then, during the session we tackle each of those problems in-depth until students can understand the problem well enough to *teach it themselves*.

<h3>Concepts First</h3>

Far too often, students learn *how* to solve math problems, but have no understanding of *why* the process they're using works. This is especially true for standardized tests, where success is tied directly to efficiency--not understanding.

However, if you deeply understand the concepts behind the SAT, a perfect score *is not a challenge*. SAT problems are not long, tedious, or complicated. They are designed to test 1-2 concepts. Understand those concepts well and you'll know exactly what the problem is trying to test.

This is obviously easier said than done. Some students are naturally faster at math than others, and some have had a more extensive math background, but every student is capable of learning. When I teach, I start at the basics and try to approach a concept from as many angles as possible until I find something that the student understands and will remember. While explaining an idea, I frequently prompt students with questions, asking them to explain the concepts back to me, identifying any gaps in understanding. **You don't truly understand something until you can teach it yourself.**

<h3>Applying a Process</h3>

Most problems on the SAT fall neatly into categories of *types* of problems--each *problem type* testing a certain concept/concepts and having its own process for finding the solution. **Building intuition comes down to connecting concepts with problem types, and problem types with processes.**

For example, let's look at Systems of Linear Equations--a problem type guaranteed to show up on every SAT. **Conceptually**, a system is a set of relationships between variables that when combined, express a specific instance (or graphically, a point). On the SAT, this **problem type** will typically have 2 equations and 2 variables, both of which can be solved for. Finally, the **processes** you can use are elimination or substitution.

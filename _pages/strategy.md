Over my 200+ hours tutoring SAT Math, I've been dedicated to continuously improving my tutoring methodology. Here is what's worked:

<h3>Practice Tests</h3>
The best way to prepare for the SAT is to take the SAT.

In general, tests don't only serve as tools for assessment, but also as tools for *learning*. Cognitive science has found testing to be a much more effective method of learning than reading, listening, or any passive means of studying material, since testing demands a certain level of difficulty and thus attention.

You might believe that the best way to test is with practice questions that are harder than the actual SAT, or with drills that reinforce a very specific type of problem. However, **the best test is going to be the one which most closely represents the actual SAT that the student takes.** This is because SAT problems are very specific, and it's easier to recall a specific process if you have done *that* process--not an adjacent one--many times before. So why not drills? Repetition alone does not help learning--deep processing does. If a student completes 10 questions which test the same process, they think deeply about the first problem and then go on autopilot for the next 9. If asked to reproduce that process a month later on their SAT, they'll be no better than a student that only did the first question.

However, when diving straight into practice tests, there are going to be concepts and processes that the student is unfamiliar with or has questions about. This is where my tutoring comes in. Students complete practice tests between tutoring sessions and come to each session with a list of problems to go over. Then, I teach the concepts and processes used to solve each problem in-depth. Some problems may take as little as 2 minutes to explain, some as long as 20-30 minutes. The goal is that students can understand the problem well enough to *teach it themselves*.

<h3>Concepts First</h3>

Far too often, students learn *how* to solve math problems, but have no understanding of *why* the process they're using works. This is especially true for standardized tests, where success is tied directly to efficiency--not understanding.

However, if you deeply understand the concepts behind the SAT, a perfect score *is not a challenge*. SAT problems are not long, tedious, or complicated. They are brief and deliberately test 1-3 ideas. Understand those ideas well and the problems *will* make sense.

This is obviously easier said than done. Some students are naturally faster at math than others, and some have had a more extensive math background, but every student is capable of learning. When I teach, I start at the basics and try to approach a concept from as many angles as possible until I find something that the student understands and will remember. While explaining an idea, I frequently prompt students with questions, asking them to explain the concepts back to me, identifying any gaps in understanding. **You don't truly understand something until you can teach it yourself.**

<h3>Applying a Process</h3>

Most problems on the SAT fall neatly into categories of *types* of problems--each *problem type* testing a certain concept/concepts and having its own process for finding the solution. **Efficiency on the SAT comes down to connecting concepts with problem types, and problem types with processes.**

For example, let's look at Systems of Linear Equations--a problem type guaranteed to show up on every SAT. **Conceptually**, a system is a set of relationships between variables that when combined, express a specific instance (or graphically, a point). On the SAT, this **problem type** will typically have 2 equations and 2 variables, both of which can be solved for. Finally, the **processes** you can use are elimination or substitution.

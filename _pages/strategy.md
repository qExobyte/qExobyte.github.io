Over my 200+ hours tutoring SAT Math, I've been dedicated to continuously improving my tutoring methodology. I've combined the practices most effective for myself and the students I've tutored with my knowledge of cognitive science and learning to tutor deliberately, in a way that not only prepares students for the SAT, but strengthens their mathematical and problem solving abilities long-term.

**Practice Tests:** The best way to prepare for the SAT is to take the SAT. Let me explain why.

In general, tests serve not only as tools for assessment, but also as tools for *learning*. Cognitive science has found testing to be a much more effective method of learning than reading, listening, or any passive means of studying material, since testing demands a certain level of difficulty and thus attention.

You might believe that the best way to test is with practice questions that are harder than the actual SAT, or with drills that reinforce a very specific type of problem. However, the best test is going to be the one which most closely represents the actual SAT that the student takes. This is because SAT problems are very specific, and it's easier to recall a specific process if you have done *that* process--not an adjacent one--many times before. So why not drills? Repetition alone does not help learning--deep processing does. If a student gets 10 questions which test the same process, they think deeply about the first problem and then go on autopilot for the next 9. If asked to reproduce that process a month later on their SAT, they'll be no better than a student that only did the first question.

However, this deep processing won't come naturally to the student for every problem. There are going to be concepts and processes that the student is unfamiliar with or has questions about. This is where my tutoring comes in. Students complete practice tests between tutoring sessions and come to each session with a list of problems to go over. Then, I teach in-depth the concepts and processes used to solve each problem. Some problems will take as little as 2 minutes to explain, some as long as 20-30 minutes. The goal is that students can understand the problem well enough to *teach it themselves*.

**Concepts first:** Many students have experienced math classes that prioritize memorization of formulas and theorems over actually *understanding* them. This not only makes learning math less interesting, but also less effective. Memorizing a narrow process only helps you solve a narrow set of problems. To get the highest score possible on the SAT, you need to be able to quickly apply familiar concepts to *unfamiliar* problems. When a student is shaky on a math concept, I start from the most fundamental ideas and build up from there, explaining the concept in a way that the student will remember long-term.

**Problem types & Solution frameworks:** In the last paragraph I said that the SAT contains *unfamiliar* problems. While this is true, there are many *problem types* that occur over and over again. If you can identify one of these recurring problem types, you can turn to a reliable process for finding the solution (a "solution framework"). Having a pre-determined plan for how to approach each type of problem allows you to move through the test *significantly* faster.

These three ideas make up the core of my math tutoring strategy. Students complete and score timed practice tests on their own between sessions, come to each session with a list of their weakest problems, and during sessions I teach the concepts and solution frameworks to prepare students for their next practice test.

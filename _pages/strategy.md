When tutoring, I employ the same practices that helped me get a perfect math score on the SAT. Here is an outline of my strategy:

**Fire before aiming:** The best way to assess strengths and weaknesses is to take the test head on--even if you feel unprepared. Whether it's taking the PSAT or completing a practice test at home (*but under testing conditions*), taking the test *before* knowing what to expect (hence firing before aiming) is the best way to start test prep. With plenty of practice tests available, my tutoring involves students completing practice tests between tutoring sessions, and spending sessions targeting *weaknesses* from those tests.

**Concepts first:** Many students have experienced math classes that prioritize memorization of formulas and theorems over actually *understanding* them. This not only makes learning math less interesting, but also less effective. Memorizing a narrow process only helps you solve a narrow set of problems. To get the highest score possible on the SAT, you need to be able to quickly apply familiar concepts to *unfamiliar* problems. When a student is shaky on a math concept, I start from the most fundamental ideas and build up from there, explaining the concept in a way that the student will remember long-term.

**Problem types & Solution frameworks:** In the last paragraph I said that the SAT contains *unfamiliar* problems. While this is true, there are many *problem types* that occur over and over again. If you can identify one of these recurring problem types, you can turn to a reliable process for finding the solution (a "solution framework"). Having a pre-determined plan for how to approach each type of problem allows you to move through the test *significantly* faster.

These three ideas make up the core of my math tutoring strategy. Students complete and score timed practice tests on their own between sessions, come to each session with a list of their weakest problems, and during sessions I teach the concepts and solution frameworks to prepare students for their next practice test.

Here are some other things I value in tutoring:

**The Feynman Technique:** The best way to know if you really understand a topic is to try explaining it. I may ask students to explain a topic to me to test their understanding.

**Spaced Repetition:** Rather than covering topics in a sequential order, I ensure that students are exposed to topics over and over throughout their entire preparation. I also recommend that students get tutored consistently over a longer period of time, rather than trying to cram SAT prep in a few weeks.

**Building a Connection with the Student:** This seems obvious, but students need to feel very comfortable around their tutor to have effective and enjoyable tutoring sessions. As someone close in age to high school students, I have a good grasp of how to communicate with students and keep them engaged, something which older tutors often neglect.

**Seeing learning from a student's perspective:** In 2016, the SAT was completely revamped by College Board. However, most SAT tutors learned and took the test far before 2016. As someone who self-studied and completed the SAT after the revamp, I can see the SAT, as well as the college admissions process surrounding it, from the perspective of a student today. I believe this does make an impact when teaching and building a connection with students.

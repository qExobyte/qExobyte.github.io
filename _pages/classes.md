I'm extremely proud to finally announce my live small-group class: **800 Academy**.

This class is intended for **highly motivated** students aiming for a **perfect** or **near-perfect** SAT math score *(750+)*. Students should enter the class with a _670 or higher_.

The class consists of **5 live sessions**, **2 hours each**, all through Google Meet. Each session covers a different topic that high-scoring students tend to struggle with. These topics are what differentiate a 650 from an 800:
- Exponential Functions
- Quadratics
- Geometry & Trig
- Statistics
- Mastering the Test

The first cohort will start on **September 7th** and meet every Saturday leading up to the October 5 SAT. The final session ("Mastering the Test") will take place the week before the October SAT. **Exact times are still to be determined.**

All 10 hours can be purchased for the sale price of **${{ site.data.settings.stats.academy-sale }}**. As students sign up, the price will increase to **${{ site.data.settings.stats.academy }}**.

Many test prep companies try packing as many students as possible into their group classes, but 800 Academy will be capped at **6 students**. This ensures that students are able to talk through problems as a group and ask questions freely.

<h1>How are classes structured?</h1>
800 Academy will follow the same rigorous methodology of my 1-on-1 tutoring sessions, just with more structure and more collaboration.

Concepts are introduced through _questions_ which encourage students to think through **first principles** and share their ideas.

Students learn multiple approaches to problems, encouraging **lateral thinking**. The hardest problems on the SAT demand creativity, not memorization.

Students walk through the **hardest** problems from the SAT question bank. We leave no stone unturned. As in, the quadratics class will cover every single type of quadratic problem the SAT might throw at you.

Since the class size is extremely small, students are **always** encouraged to ask questions during class. However, if a student finds a certain subtopic especially difficult, I've created a problem set for every single subtopic.

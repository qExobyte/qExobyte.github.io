Want the **structure** of an online course but with the **small size** of a tutoring session? Check out my group class!

This class is intended for **highly motivated** students aiming for a **perfect** or **near-perfect** SAT math score *(750+)*. Students should enter the class with a _650 or higher_.

The class consists of **6 live sessions**, **2 hours each**, all through Google Meet. Each session is a deep dive into a different topic that high-scoring students tend to struggle with. These topics are what differentiate a 670 from an 800:
- Exponential Functions
- Quadratics
- Geometry & Trig
- Word Problems
- Statistics
- Big-Picture Strategies & Review

Many test prep companies try packing as many students as possible into their group classes, but my classes are capped at **6-10 students**. This ensures that students are able to talk through problems as a group and ask questions freely.

The next cohort will begin on **October 19, 2024**. Classes will be **Saturday afternoons from 12:00 - 2:00 pm EST**, to prepare students for the December 7th SAT.

<h1>How are classes structured?</h1>
My group classes follow the same rigorous methodology of my 1-on-1 tutoring sessions, just with more structure and more collaboration.

Concepts are introduced through _questions_ which encourage students to think through **first principles** and share their ideas.

Students learn multiple approaches to problems, encouraging **lateral thinking**. The hardest problems on the SAT demand creativity, not memorization.

Students walk through the **hardest** problems from the SAT question bank. We leave no stone unturned. That is, the quadratics class will cover every single type of quadratic problem the SAT might throw at you.

<div id="concept-review">
</div>
I teach concepts through **first principles** and provide "concept reviews" for students to work on outside of class. I provide around 25-40 of these questions per class.

For each class, I provide recommended exercises from **<a href="https://thecollegepanda.app/" target="_blank">CollegePanda</a>**'s book to use as a supplement. I've also organized every hard official problem by subtopic, so students can focus on their weaknesses.

Want the **structure** of an online course but with the **small size** of a tutoring session? Check out the **SAT Math Masterclass!**

This class is intended for **highly motivated** students aiming for a **perfect** or **near-perfect** SAT math score *(750+)*. Students should enter the class with a _650 or higher_.

The class consists of **6 live sessions**, **2 hours each**, all through Google Meet. Each session is a deep dive into the **hardest** concepts & problems in **every** category on the SAT Math.  

Unlike self-paced courses and the live classes run by large test-prep companies, my group class is small enough for students to freely ask **questions** and talk through their ideas. The class is as much a **discussion** as a lecture, and active engagement is **vital**.

[//]: # (The next cohort will begin on **January 25, 2025**. Classes will be **Saturday afternoons from 12:00 - 2:00 pm EST**, to prepare students for the March SAT. Here is the schedule:)
The current cohort began on January 25, **but you can still join**! All sessions are recorded, so you can catch up on everything you missed and join the remaining live sessions. Here's the schedule:

- 1/25 - Algebra, Functions, Systems of Equations
- 2/1 - Word Problems & Exponential Functions
- 2/8 - Quadratics
- 2/15 - Geometry & Trig
- 2/22 - Statistics
- 3/1 - Review Session

But wait! The next cohort will begin on **March 22, 2025**, in preparation for the May SAT. If you'd like to claim a spot, send me an <a href="/classes/#class-questions">email below</a>.

<h1>How are classes structured?</h1>
My group classes follow the same rigorous methodology of my 1-on-1 tutoring sessions, just with more structure and more collaboration.

Concepts are introduced through _questions_ which encourage students to think through **first principles** and share their ideas.
<div class="panel--content panel-override" style="max-width: 500px">

</div>
<br>

Students learn multiple approaches to problems, encouraging **lateral thinking**. The hardest problems on the SAT demand creativity, not memorization.

<br>

Students walk through the **hardest** problems from the SAT question bank. We leave no stone unturned. That is, the quadratics class will cover every single type of quadratic problem the SAT might throw at you.

<div id="concept-review">
</div>
I teach concepts through **first principles** and provide "concept reviews" for students to work on outside of class. I provide around 25-40 of these questions per class.

Finally, I provide recommended exercises from the **<a href="https://thecollegepanda.app/" target="_blank">CollegePanda</a>** and <a href="https://www.preppros.io/math-book">PrepPros</a> books for students to **practice**. Here is how I recommend students study in between each session:

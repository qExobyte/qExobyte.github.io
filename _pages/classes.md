I'm extremely proud to finally announce my live small-group class: **800 Academy**. I know, the name is cheesy.

This class is intended for **highly motivated** students aiming for a **perfect** or **near-perfect** SAT math score *(750+)*. Students should enter the class with a _670 or higher_.

The class consists of **5 live sessions**, **2 hours each**, all through Google Meet. Each session covers a different topic that high-scoring students tend to struggle with. These topics are what differentiate a 650 from an 800:
- Exponential Functions
- Quadratics
- Geometry & Trig
- Statistics
- Big-Picture Strategies & Review

Many test prep companies try packing as many students as possible into their group classes, but 800 Academy will be capped at **6 students**. This ensures that students are able to talk through problems as a group and ask questions freely.

The next cohort will host classes on **Saturday afternoons** throughout October and November, to prepare students for the **December 7th SAT**.

<h1>How are classes structured?</h1>
800 Academy will follow the same rigorous methodology of my 1-on-1 tutoring sessions, just with more structure and more collaboration.

Concepts are introduced through _questions_ which encourage students to think through **first principles** and share their ideas.

Students learn multiple approaches to problems, encouraging **lateral thinking**. The hardest problems on the SAT demand creativity, not memorization.

Students walk through the **hardest** problems from the SAT question bank. We leave no stone unturned. That is, the quadratics class will cover every single type of quadratic problem the SAT might throw at you.

I teach concepts through **first principles** and provide "concept reviews" to test students' understanding. Each class has around 25-40 of these questions.

Since the class size is extremely small, students are **always** encouraged to ask questions during class. However, if a student finds a certain subtopic difficult, I've created a problem set for every single subtopic. I also collect a feedback form each class to get an idea of how students feel about pacing and which topics students are struggling with the most.

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: normal;">The most efficient path to a <b>750+.</b></h2>
<br>

Want the **structure** of an online course but with the **small size** of a tutoring session? Check out the **SAT Math Masterclass!**

This class is intended for **highly motivated** students aiming for a **perfect** or **near-perfect** SAT math score *(750+)*. Students should enter the class with a _650 or higher_.

The class consists of **6 live sessions**, **2 hours each**, all through Google Meet. Each session is a deep dive into the **hardest** concepts & problems in **every** category on the SAT Math.

Unlike self-paced courses and the live classes run by large test-prep companies, my group class is small enough for students to freely ask **questions** and talk through their ideas. The class is as much a **discussion** as a lecture, and active engagement is **vital**.

[//]: # (The next cohort will begin on **January 25, 2025**. Classes will be **Saturday afternoons from 12:00 - 2:00 pm EST**, to prepare students for the March SAT. Here is the schedule:)
The current cohort began on January 25, **but you can still join**! All sessions are recorded, so you can catch up on everything you missed and join the remaining live sessions. Here's the schedule:

- 1/25 - Algebra, Functions, Systems of Equations
- 2/1 - Word Problems & Exponential Functions
- 2/8 - Quadratics
- 2/15 - Geometry & Trig
- 2/22 - Statistics
- 3/1 - Review Session

But wait! The next cohort will begin on **March 22, 2025**, in preparation for the May SAT. If you'd like to claim a spot, send me an <a href="/classes/#class-questions">email below</a>.

<h2>How are classes structured?</h2>
My group classes follow the same rigorous methodology of my 1-on-1 tutoring sessions, just with more structure and more collaboration.

Concepts are introduced through _questions_ which encourage students to think through **first principles** and share their ideas.
<div class="panel--content panel-override" style="max-width: 500px">
    <img src="/images/academy1.jpg" alt="test">
</div>
<br>

Students learn multiple approaches to problems, encouraging **lateral thinking**. The hardest problems on the SAT demand creativity, not memorization.
<div class="panel--content panel-override">
    <img src="/images/academy3.jpg" alt="test">
</div>
<br>

Students walk through the **hardest** problems from the SAT question bank. We leave no stone unturned. That is, the quadratics class will cover every single type of quadratic problem the SAT might throw at you.
<div class="panel--content panel-override">

<br>

<div id="concept-review">
</div>
I teach concepts through **first principles** and provide "concept reviews" for students to work on outside of class. I provide around 25-40 of these questions per class.

Finally, I provide recommended exercises from the **<a href="https://thecollegepanda.app/" target="_blank">CollegePanda</a>** and <a href="https://www.preppros.io/math-book">PrepPros</a> books for students to **practice**. Here is how I recommend students study in between each session:

<details>
    <summary>How small is the class?</summary>
    <div>
        It depends on how many students sign up but I'm aiming for around 10-15 students.
        <br><br>
        That being said, since the sessions are recorded, expect a lot of absences. Last cohort, I capped the class at 10 students and some classes had as few as 4-6 students. So don't worry, it'll be <b>far</b> more interactive than your typical high school class.
    </div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What do I need for the class?</summary>
    <div>
        <li>Computer</li>
        <li>Internet</li>
        <li>Microphone</li>
        <li>Paper & pencil</li>
        <li>A score of 650 or higher</li>
        <br>
        That's it. Preferably, a webcam as well. I <b>strongly</b> encourage students to turn on their cameras, but I'm not gonna kill you if you don't have one.
    </div>

<details>
    <summary>Do I need to buy myself the College Panda book?</summary>
    <div>
        If you want a physical copy, yes. If you want a digital copy, I'll buy one for you.
    </div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Do I neeeeeeed to have a 650?</summary>
    <div>
        I'm not gonna stop you from joining the class with a lower score, but if you're under a 650, the class will probably be too hard for you. It's certainly possible for you to catch up, but you'll have to put in more effort than the other students at the start of the class.
    </div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>What's covered in the review session?</summary>
    <div>
        The review session is probably my favorite part of the class. We go back through the material at a very high level and then play a game where students compete to explain the hardest problems as quickly and accurately as possible. It gets pretty heated.
    </div>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Can I get a refund if I change my mind?</summary>
    <div>
        If you realize after the first session and before the second session that the class is not fit for you, I'll refund 3/4 of the class's price. So, if the class is ${{ site.data.settings.stats.class }}, I'll refund ${{ site.data.settings.stats.class | times: 3 | times: 0.25 }}.
        <br><br>
        If you get a refund, you'll no longer have access to any of the class's recordings or resources. So far, however, I have not had a single student out of 30 students request a refund. Hope to keep it that way!
    </div>

<details>
    <summary>What if YOU (Eric) need to miss a session?</summary>
    <div>
        I've never cancelled a class, but in the case of sickness, technical difficulties, or an emergency, I might need to. 
        <br><br>
        If I need to cancel, I'll send out a "when2meet" to see which times everyone is free, and reschedule the session to the best time. Worst case scenario, you'll need to watch the recording.

Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science, Economics, and Math, and I've been tutoring the SAT Math for over {{ site.data.settings.stats.years }} years.

<img class="about-img" src="/images/score.jpg" align="right" alt="score 800">
As both a student and a tutor, I've developed strategies for learning math effectively and succeeding on the SAT. **These strategies enabled me to earn a perfect math score on the SAT both times I took it. My goal as a tutor is to help other students do the same.**

Since then, I've tutored over **150** students across the globe, run several successful masterclasses, and created educational videos on YouTube with over **{{ site.data.settings.stats.subs }}** subscribers and **{{ site.data.settings.stats.views }} million** views.

<details>
    <summary>Should I get 1-on-1 tutoring or join the Masterclass?</summary>
    <div>
        If you're scoring under a 630, then 1-on-1 sessions. You should always prioritize the <b>easiest</b> problems that you're missing, and the group classes will focus on the SAT math's hardest problems.
        <br><br>
        If you're scoring above a 630, then I'd recommend the Masterclass, with 1-on-1 sessions as a supplement if needed. Think of the Masterclass as teaching you the content of the test and 1-on-1 sessions as "office hours" for the topics and problems that you just can't wrap your head around. Not to mention, group classes cost much less!

    <summary>What makes your tutoring better than test prep companies?</summary>
    <div>
        A simple google search for "princeton review tutor salaries" or "kaplan tutor salaries" shows that they pay their tutors around $20-$40/hr, despite charging $175-$250/hr for their tutoring. You're not paying for the tutor, you're paying for the brand.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, their exorbitant bundles (up to $10,000!) prioritize quantity over quality. They advertise hundreds of unengaging videos and thousands of problems (which are increasingly AI-generated or outsourced), but students <i>only have so much time</i>. My tutoring is focused on <b>efficiency</b> and <b>outcomes</b>. At any point in our prep, we focus all attention on the topic that yields the highest return in the lowest amount of time.

<details>
    <summary>Do you assign homework? How much?</summary>
    <div>
        It's ultimately up to the student, but I recommend that students spend around 1-3 hours working on new material and 30-60 minutes <a href="/strategy/#repetition">reviewing past material</a> between sessions. Then, students come to each session with a list of problems to review, topics to learn, and questions to ask.

    <summary>What if I want to cancel a session?</summary>
    <div>
        Sessions are fully refundable as long as you cancel at least <b>6 hours</b> before the scheduled start time. Otherwise, the full session price is charged. You can see all my cancellation/refund policies <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gsNy5ngG6lYokAvQl1V4q3d-y1eEUHRO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <summary>Do you tutor the English as well?</summary>
    <div>
        Unfortunately, no. :(

<details>
    <summary>How much will my score improve with x hours of tutoring?</summary>
    <div>
        At the end of the day, there's no golden ticket where you can pay a certain amount of money for a certain SAT score. Almost every test prep company that advertises score guarantees has caveats in the fineprint (i.e. "must complete all 500 hours of material"). 
        <br><br>
        Instead, I prefer to let the results of students speak for themselves. Most Masterclass students score over a 750, and many of my 1-on-1 students improve 150+ points or surpass their personal goals. But this progress inevitably takes <b>time and effort.</b> I don't want a score guarantee to relieve students of accountability or disincentivize perseverance.

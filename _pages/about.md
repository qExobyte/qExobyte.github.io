Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science & Economics, and I've been tutoring SAT Math for the last 2 years.

<img src="/images/score.jpg" align="right">
As both a student and a tutor, I've developed strategies for learning math effectively and succeeding on the SAT. **These strategies enabled me to earn a perfect math score on the SAT both times I took it. My goal as a tutor is to help other students do the same.**

I've tutored students all across the country, from schools on the West Coast to TJHSST, America's #1 public high school here in Northern Virginia. My tutoring is simple yet effective--most recently, I've helped a student get from a satisfactory 660 to a near perfect 760 in only 8 sessions. No matter your comfort with math, if you're determined to learn, I'd love to help you become a stronger problem solver.
  
My tutoring takes place online through Google Meet. In case you're unsure if my tutoring would be best, **I offer a 30 minute trial session *completely free*.** If you're happy with this trial session, we can schedule paid sessions for the prices listed below.

<h2>How flexible are your tutoring sessions?</h2>
My tutoring is incredibly flexible, especially compared to other private tutors. More often than not, I have time slots available every day of the week. Even for the 8 hour and 20 hour bundles, where we would plan a recurring schedule in advance, there is plenty of wiggle room. As of right now, sessions can be rescheduled or cancelled as soon as *30 minutes* before the session start time, a policy more lenient than any other tutor I've seen.

<h2>How does your tutoring compare to that of older, more experienced tutors?</h2>
As a college student, there are certainly some pros and cons to my age. I am not a full time tutor and I don't have several decades of teaching experience under my belt. However, the SAT Math is a small and predictable test--not to mention its current form has only been around since 2016. After 2 years preparing for the test and another 2 years teaching it, I understand the SAT Math as well as any full time tutor, *and I'm probably half the price*. 

Also, many students prefer a tutor closer to them in age. I've been told by students that their previous tutors have bored them into hating math, while I'm engaging and easy to talk to. It's important that students genuinely enjoy their studying, and I hope to foster that environment.

<h2>How do you keep students accountable outside of tutoring sessions?</h2>
There has to be a certain point where students are responsible for their own learning, but I do have ways to keep students motivated and accountable. Since my tutoring revolves around practice tests, I insist that students complete and score 1-2 sections between each session. This takes between 30-90 minutes. The scores from these practice tests are tracked in a spreadsheet to show students' progress over time.

Additionally, when students are struggling with focus, memory, or time management, I work with them to find solutions. I not only love math, but also cognitive science, and I have a multitude of strategies for learning and studying based on my knowledge of the field. Much of accountability is simply having the right mindset and approach.

<h2>Given that you're an undergraduate student, what is your math experience?</h2>
Here are all the math courses I've completed:
<li>Algebra 1</li>
<li>Geometry</li>
<li>Algebra 2 (this concludes the extent of the SAT curriculum)</li>
<li>Precalculus & Trigonometry</li>
<li>Discrete Math</li>
<li>AP Calculus BC (Calc 1 & 2) -- AP Score: 5 -- AB Subscore: 5</li>
<li>Multivariable Calculus (Calc 3)</li>
<li>Probability</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<br>

Outside of these courses, I'm majoring in computer science and economics, so almost all of my college courses involve some amount of math and a whole lot of problem solving. I've also taken two years of calculus-based physics. This is truly overkill for the SAT Math, but I want to be transparent about my experience.

As for the SAT, I scored a 1570 (770 EBRW / 800 Math). <br>
I took the SAT twice and the PSAT once, earning a perfect math score on all 3 exams.

<h2>How do you teach the SAT Math?</h2>
An in-depth look at my strategy for the SAT Math is found [here](https://learnsatmath.com/strategy/).

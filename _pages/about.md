Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science, Economics, and Math, and I've been tutoring the SAT Math for over 2 years.

<img src="/images/score.jpg" align="right">
As both a student and a tutor, I've developed strategies for learning math effectively and succeeding on the SAT. **These strategies enabled me to earn a perfect math score on the SAT both times I took it. My goal as a tutor is to help other students do the same.**

I've tutored students across the globe, from international schools in Asia to TJHSST, America's #1 public high school here in Northern Virginia. My tutoring is simple yet effective--with just 8 hours of sessions, I've helped students improve up to 200 points! No matter your comfort with math, if you're determined to learn, I'd love to help you become a stronger problem solver.
  
My tutoring takes place online through Google Meet. In case you're unsure if my tutoring would be best, send me an email and we'll discuss how best to help you succeed on the SAT Math.

<h2>How flexible are your tutoring sessions?</h2>
Finding time for sessions has never been a problem for any of my students, and I wish to keep it that way. I'm on Eastern Standard Time and tend to tutor later in the evening, but I have *some* range of availability every day of the week. If you ever need to reschedule or cancel a session, I ask that I'm notified at least *30 minutes* in advance--a policy more lenient than any other private tutor I've seen.

<h2>How much will my score improve after 8 hours of tutoring?</h2>
This is my most asked question, but unfortunately, it's impossible to answer. I've seen students go from high 500s to high 700s in just 8 sessions, but I've also seen students that are inconsistent and don't seem to have steady growth. I can't tell you how much your score will improve, but I *can* guarantee that you'll improve faster with a tutor than without.

<h2>How do you keep students accountable outside of tutoring sessions?</h2>
Since my tutoring revolves around practice tests, I insist that all students complete and score a practice test before coming to each session. This takes around 75-90 minutes. Any supplemental preparation (drilling processes, reviewing old problems, internalizing unfamiliar concepts) is at the student's discretion, but may certainly help with improvement. Practice test scores are tracked in a spreadsheet to show students' progress over time.

Furthermore, time management, focus, and memory are all parts of SAT prep that shouldn't be neglected. As a tutor, I'll provide strategies backed by cognitive science to help students with motivation and efficiency.

<h2>What is your educational experience?</h2>
At the University of Virginia, I'm most of the way through a degree in Computer Science and Economics, and I'm pursuing a minor in Mathematics. I currently have a 3.9 GPA.

Outside of school, I'll be working this summer as a software engineering intern at Wells Fargo, and I'll be participating in SIG's Discovery Day program for quantitative trading.

I also play violin in UVA's student-run symphony orchestra and am an avid poker player!

Some courses I've completed include:
<li>AP Calculus BC (Calc 1 & 2) -- AP Score: 5 -- AB Subscore: 5</li>
<li>Multivariable Calculus (Calc 3)</li>
<li>Calculus-based Physics - Mechanics & Electricity/Magnetism</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Discrete Math & Theory</li>
<li>Probability (college-level)</li>
<li>Statistics (college-level)</li>
<li>Data Structures & Algorithms 1 & 2</li>
<li>Computer Systems & Organization 1 & 2</li>
<li>Intermediate Micro & Macroeconomics</li> <br>

As for the SAT, I scored a 1570 (770 EBRW / 800 Math). <br>
I took the SAT twice and the PSAT once, earning a perfect math score on all 3 exams.

Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a first-year at the University of Virginia studying computer science, and I've been tutoring SAT Math for over a year. 

<img src="/images/score.jpg" align="right">
As both a student and a tutor, I've developed sets of strategies for learning math effectively and succeeding on the SAT. **These strategies enabled me to earn a perfect math score on the SAT both times I took it. My goal as a tutor is to help other students do the same.**

  
My tutoring takes place online through Google Meet. In case you're unsure if my tutoring would be best, **I offer 1 hour of tutoring *completely free*.** If you're happy with this trial session, we can schedule recurring sessions for **$30/hr.**

If you're curious about how I teach the SAT, check out my [Strategy](https://learnsatmath.com/strategy/)

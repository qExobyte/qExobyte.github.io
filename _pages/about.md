Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a rising first-year at the University of Virginia studying computer science. In high school, I became interested in the methodology behind learning--especially learning math. I developed strategies for understanding math deeply and preparing for exams efficiently.

**With these strategies, I was able to earn a perfect math score on the PSAT and a perfect math score on the SAT both times I took it. Now, I want to help other students do the same.**


I've been tutoring the SAT Math for over a year now, and I've seen students not only improve their SAT scores, but also genuinely enjoy tutoring sessions. 

  
My tutoring takes place online through Google Meet. In case you're unsure if my tutoring would be best, **I offer 1 hour of tutoring *completely free*.** If you're happy with this trial session, we can schedule recurring sessions for **$30/hr.**

If you're curious about how I teach the SAT, check out my [Strategy](https://learnsatmath.com/strategy/)

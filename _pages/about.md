Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science, Economics, and Math, and I've been tutoring the SAT Math for over 2 years.

<img src="/images/score.jpg" align="right">
As both a student and a tutor, I've developed strategies for learning math effectively and succeeding on the SAT. **These strategies enabled me to earn a perfect math score on the SAT both times I took it. My goal as a tutor is to help other students do the same.**

I've tutored students across the globe, from international schools in Asia to TJHSST, America's #1 (at the time) public high school here in Northern Virginia. My tutoring is simple yet effective--with just 8 hours of sessions, I've helped students improve up to 200 points! No matter your comfort with math, if you're determined to learn, I'd love to help you become a stronger problem solver.
  
My tutoring takes place online through Google Meet. If you're interested in getting your score up, send me an email and we'll plan a session.

<h2>How flexible are your tutoring sessions?</h2>
Finding time for sessions has never been a problem for any of my students, and I wish to keep it that way. I'm on Eastern Daylight Time and tend to tutor later in the evening, but I have *some* range of availability every day of the week. If you ever need to reschedule or cancel a session, I ask that I'm notified at least *30 minutes* in advance--a policy more lenient than any other private tutor I've seen.

<h2>What materials do you use?</h2>
Only official practice questions from College Board. I explain why in the [Strategy](https://learnsatmath.com/strategy/) section.

<h2>Do you assign homework? How much?</h2>
I insist that students complete a practice test or problem set before each session. This takes around 75-90 minutes. Any supplemental preparation (drilling processes, reviewing old problems, internalizing unfamiliar concepts) is at the student’s discretion, but may certainly help with improvement. Practice test scores are tracked in a spreadsheet to show students’ progress over time.

<h2>Why 8 hours? How much gets covered in that time?</h2>
The number is somewhat arbitrary, but 8 hours is typically enough time for students to make good progress without being too large of a commitment. Typically, students meet 1 hour a week, but these sessions can be spaced however you’d like.

<h2>How much will my score improve after 8 hours of tutoring?</h2>
This is my most frequently asked question, but unfortunately, it's impossible to answer. I've seen students go from high 500s to high 700s in just 8 sessions, but I've also seen students that have trouble internalizing the math and therefore, don't have steady growth. I can't tell you exactly how much your score will improve, but I *can* guarantee that you'll improve faster with a tutor than without one.

<h2>What is your educational experience?</h2>
At the University of Virginia, I'm most of the way through a degree in Computer Science and Economics, and I'm pursuing a minor in Mathematics. I currently have a 3.9 GPA.

Outside of school, I'm working this summer as a software engineering intern at Wells Fargo, and I've participated in Susquehanna International Group's Discovery Day program for quantitative trading.

I also play violin in UVA's student-run symphony orchestra and love to play poker!

Some courses I've completed include:
<li>AP Calculus BC (Calc 1 & 2) -- AP Score: 5 -- AB Subscore: 5</li>
<li>Multivariable Calculus (Calc 3)</li>
<li>Calculus-based Physics - Mechanics & Electricity/Magnetism</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Discrete Math & Theory</li>
<li>Probability (college-level)</li>
<li>Statistics (college-level)</li>
<li>Data Structures & Algorithms 1 & 2</li>
<li>Computer Systems & Organization 1 & 2</li>
<li>Intermediate Micro & Macroeconomics</li> <br>

As for the SAT, I scored a 1570 (770 EBRW / 800 Math). <br>
I took the SAT twice and the PSAT once, earning a perfect math score on all 3 exams.

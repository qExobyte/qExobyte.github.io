Hi, I'm Eric.

I'm a student at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science, Economics, and Math, and I've been tutoring the SAT Math for over {{ site.data.settings.stats.years }} years.

<img src="/images/score.jpg" align="right">
As both a student and a tutor, I've developed strategies for learning math effectively and succeeding on the SAT. **These strategies enabled me to earn a perfect math score on the SAT both times I took it. My goal as a tutor is to help other students do the same.**

I've tutored students across the globe, from international schools in Asia to TJHSST, America's #1 (at the time) public high school here in Northern Virginia. My tutoring is simple yet effective--with just 8 hours of sessions, I've helped students improve up to 200 points! No matter your comfort with math, if you're determined to learn, I'd love to help you become a stronger problem solver.
  
If you're interested in getting your score up, book a session below!

<h1 align="center" class="section__title">FAQ</h1>

<h2>What materials do you use?</h2>
Official practice questions from College Board are the priority (I explain why in the [Strategy](https://learnsatmath.com/strategy/) section). I ask that every student completes one <a href="https://bluebook.collegeboard.org/students" target="_blank">Bluebook</a> test prior to our first session. I've also created my own <a href="/academy/#concept-review">concept review questions</a> for students. For high scoring students, I recommend <a href="https://thecollegepanda.app/" target="_blank">CollegePanda</a>'s book as a supplement.

<h2>Do you assign homework? How much?</h2>
I ask that between each session, students review challenging topics/problems from the previous session and complete a practice test or problem set for the following session. This is around 2 hours of individual prep for every 1 hour of tutoring.

<h2>What if I want to cancel a session?</h2>
Sessions are fully refundable as long as you cancel at least **6 hours** before the scheduled start time. Otherwise, the full session price is charged. You can see all my cancellation/refund policies <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gsNy5ngG6lYokAvQl1V4q3d-y1eEUHRO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Do I need to book every session with Calendly?</h2>
No. Only book the first session with <a href="/#book">Calendly</a>. At the end of our first session, we'll discuss a personalized long-term plan and schedule future sessions accordingly.

<h2>Do you tutor the English as well?</h2>
I've spent the last 3 years specializing in SAT math prep, so I know the test back to front, but I'm **not** strong enough in the English section to tutor it.

<h2>How much will my score improve after 8 hours of tutoring?</h2>
At the end of the day, there's no golden ticket where you can pay a certain amount of money for a certain SAT score. Almost every test prep company that advertises score guarantees has caveats in the fineprint. If a student doesn't put in effort, then 8 hours will get them nowhere. If a student is critical of their learning and practices consistently, then I've seen up to 200 point improvement.

<h2>What is your educational experience?</h2>
At the University of Virginia, I'm most of the way through a degree in Computer Science and Economics, and I'm pursuing a minor in Mathematics. I currently have a 3.9 GPA.

Outside of school, I've worked as a software engineering intern at Wells Fargo, and participated in Susquehanna International Group's Discovery Day program for quantitative trading.

I also play violin in UVA's student-run symphony orchestra and love to play poker!

Some courses I've completed include:
<li>AP Calculus BC (Calc 1 & 2) -- AP Score: 5 -- AB Subscore: 5</li>
<li>Multivariable Calculus (Calc 3)</li>
<li>Calculus-based Physics - Mechanics & Electricity/Magnetism</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Discrete Math & Theory</li>
<li>Probability (college-level)</li>
<li>Statistics (college-level)</li>
<li>Data Structures & Algorithms 1 & 2</li>
<li>Computer Systems & Organization 1 & 2</li>
<li>Intermediate Micro & Macroeconomics</li> <br>

As for the SAT, I scored a 1570 (770 EBRW / 800 Math). <br>
I took the SAT twice and the PSAT once, earning a perfect math score on all 3 exams.

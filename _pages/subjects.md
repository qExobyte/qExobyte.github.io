Although I specialize in SAT Math, I also have experience tutoring other subjects! These include:
<li>Algebra 2</li>
<li>Precalculus / Trigonometry</li>
<li>AP Computer Science A</li>
<li>College Consulting / Essay Reviewing</li>

<br>
For all of the subjects above, my rate and policies are the same as with SAT Math. You can book a trial session just like you would for SAT tutoring with the button below:
